- The project has no storyboard, contains navigation controller and a tabBarController. Navigation bar has png images. Pressing bar items leads to screens.

- First screen has a StackView, second has TableView, third has a CollectionView.

- StackView is filled with custom made Alarm views and can be scrolled.
